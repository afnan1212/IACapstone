Hypervisor Security Assessment

# Executive Summary
the security of cloud computing is very important because everything now works by cloud computing system. Cloud computing “is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction” (Peter M. & Timothy G., 2011). In the cloud computing, the virtual machine is running by a software that run the virtual machine. The security of the hypervisor is extremely important because it is the component of the virtualization between the virtual machines. the hypervisor could be assessing by the hypervisor assessment tool. The hypervisor assessment tool is helps to discover any vulnerabilities in the software and protect the virtual environment from any attack. In this project, the team will work on Hypervisor Security Assessment because ………by using Virtualization Assessment Toolset (VASTO). VASTO is “a collection of Metasploit modules meant to be used as a testing tool to perform penetration tests or security audit of virtualization solutions” (the virtualization Guy); VASTO determine any weakness and vulnerability of the hypervisor Xen which lead the team to exploit one of the vulnerabilities.
so, the team project Goals are: 
1.	Using VASTO to determine the weakness/vulnerability of the Xen hypervisor
2.	Exploit of the vulnerabilities.

## User Stories

As a **cloud service provider**, I want to **isolate client resources** so that I can **host multiple clients on the same hardware**.

As an **enterprise user**, I want to **seperate sensitive data on to its own system** to **provide additional security**.

As a **healthcare provider**, I want to **isolate identifying information from other data** to **comply with HIPAA regulations**.

As an **enterprise user**, I want to **provide an isolated environment from production systems** so that I can **safely perform malware analysis**.

As a **corporation**, I want to **run multiple virtual systems on the same hardware** in order to **reduce cost and space requirements**.
